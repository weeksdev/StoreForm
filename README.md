This js file is to be used within an ExtJS 4 application.  I can be extended similar to the sample below:

Ext.define('App.view.MyForm',{
  extend:'App.view.StoreForm',
  store:'myStore',
});

The available methods to iterate the records are:
getFirstRecord()
  sets form to first item in store
getNextRecord()
  sets form to next item in store
getPreviousRecord()
  sets form to previous item in store
getLastRecord()
  sets form to last item in store
syncRecord()
  syncs changes to form with selected record in store
reset()
  resets the form (makes form blank and not tied to record)
setRecordByIndex(index)
  sets current record on form to the index specified
setRecordByField(fieldName,fieldValue)
  sets current record on form based on field name and field value specified (sets to first match)

Additional Configs:
syncRecordOnChange
  defaults to false
  will auto sync fields on form with store record on change event
hasId:
  defaults to false
  defines whether there is an id field available within the store required idName to be defined for use
  
Record Iteration Variables:
  bool containsRecords
  bool endOfStore
  bool startOfStore
  int? selectedIndex
